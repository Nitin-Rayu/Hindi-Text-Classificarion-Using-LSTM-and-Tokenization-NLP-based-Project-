Text classification is a machine learning technique for categorizing open-ended text into a collection of predetermined categories. Text classifiers can organize, arrange, and categorize almost any type of text, including documents, medical research, and files, as well as text found on the internet. New articles, for example, can be categorized by themes; support tickets can be prioritized; chat dialogues can be categorized by language; brand mentions can be categorized by sentiment; and so on. Text classification is a basic problem in natural language processing that has a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent identification.
